# CppAcademia

Welcome to my C++ portfolio repository!  
  
This repository showcases the C++ assignments I completed during my time at Seneca College. I have re-done all my college work to include it in my resume, demonstrating my skills and understanding of C++. Each assignment is accompanied by detailed documentation and code, and all assignments are verified to be leaks-proof using Apple's Leaks tool.

While I may not always remember every detail, revisiting the official documentation enables me to quickly understand and solve problems effectively.
